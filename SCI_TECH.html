                In a groundbreaking discovery that sheds 
                new light on the prehistoric origins of 
                art and human creativity, researchers 
                from Aarhus University have identified 
                the earliest known use of blue pigment 
                in Europe.

            <pre class="Paragraphs">
                At the Final Paleolithic site of Mühlheim-
                Dietesheim in Germany, archaeologists 
                from Aarhus University identified a faint 
                blue residue on a stone artifact that is 
                roughly 13,000 years old. After applying 
                several advanced scientific techniques, 
                the team determined that the material was 
                the mineral pigment azurite, known for 
                its intense blue color and not previously 
                documented in Europe’s Paleolithic 
                artistic record.

                “This challenges what we thought we knew 
                about Paleolithic pigment use,” said Dr. Izzy 
                Wisher, the lead author of the study.

                A Stone Palette Reveals New Possibilities
                The stone bearing the azurite traces was 
                originally thought to be an oil lamp. Now, 
                it appears to have been a mixing surface or 
                palette for preparing blue pigments — hinting 
                at artistic or cosmetic traditions that remain 
                    largely invisible today.

                Until recently, researchers assumed that 
                Paleolithic artists relied almost entirely on 
                red and black pigments, since virtually no
                other colors appear in surviving artworks from 
                this era. Many experts attributed this pattern 
                to either the scarcity of blue minerals or their 
                limited appeal.
                Because blue tones are missing from known 
                Paleolithic art, the new finding raises the 
                possibility that blue pigments were instead 
                applied to the body or used to color textiles, 
                activities that rarely preserve well in the 
                archaeological record.

            <pre class="Paragraphs">
                “The presence of azurite shows that Paleolithic 
                people had a deep knowledge of mineral pigments 
                and could access a much broader color palette 
                than we previously thought – and they may have 
                been selective in the way they used certain 
                colors,” Izzy Wisher says.

                The findings urge a rethink of Paleolithic art 
                and color use, opening new avenues for exploring 
                how early humans expressed identity, status, and 
                beliefs through materials far more varied and 
                vibrant than previously imagined.

    <pre class="Paragraphs">
        Lise Meitner was an Austrian-Swedish physicist who helped discover nuclear fission, the process that splits atom and releases 
        huge amounts of energy. Her work let to major scientific advances, including nuclear power and medical applications.

                Even though she made major contribution, she was not 
                given the Nobel Prize, which may believe she deserved. 
                She is remembered today as one of the most important 
                woman in science. 

                Her most important work happened in 1938. She worked in 
                Berlin, Germany and later continued her research in Sweden 
                after fleeing from the Nazis. She studied atoms to 
                understand how matter works and why certain elements 
                behave the way they do. 

                Meitner lived her life in the service of science. She 
                never married and had no children. Her main recreation 
                was walking, she enjoyed going on very long walks. She 
                also loved music and regurlary attend concerts.

        Lise Meitner died at the age of 89 in Cambridge on October 27, 1968, after being weakened by a second broken hip and a number of 
        small strokes. She was buried in the churchyard of St James Church, Bramley, close to where her youngest brother had been buried 
        a few years previously.

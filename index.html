                Quezon City — Greenpeace Philippines 
                today called out the obscene greed 
                of government officials and 
                contractors who have allegedly 
                pocketed billions from anomalous 
                flood control projects that are
                meant for climate adaptation. In a 
                press conference over Zoom, 
                Greenpeace calculated that, based on 
                estimations revealed at Senate 
                inquiries, as much as PHP 1.089 
                trillion of the government’s 
                climate-tagged expenditures could 
                have potentially been lost to 
                corruption since 2023, including 
                PHP 560 billion in 2025 alone.

                Data from the National Integrated 
                Climate Change Database and 
                Information Exchange System 
                (NICCDIES) website shows that in 
                2025, the Department of Public 
                Works and Highways (DPWH) holds 
                the lion’s share of the climate-tagged 
                projects: PHP 800 billion of the 
                PHP 1 trillion of climate-tagged 
                projects fell under its purview, 
                comprising 90%, or 24,764 out of 
                26,874 climate-tagged projects. Of 
                this, based on estimations, around 
                PHP 560 billion of the PHP 800 
                billion is potentially being lost to 
                corruption. DPWH climate-tagged 
                flood-related projects in 2025 total 
                PHP 248 billion, of which, by the same 
                estimation, PHP 173 billion is 
                vulnerable to corruption.

                “A trillion pesos is a staggering, 
                absurd amount, siphoned by avaricious, 
                self-serving officials and contractor 
                corporations from projects meant to help 
                people cope with escalating climate 
                impacts,” said Greenpeace campaigner 
                Jefferson Chua. “This is unacceptable. 
                They’re not just plundering government 
                coffers, they’re also crippling the
                ability of millions of Filipinos to 
                survive in the face of an escalating 
                climate crisis. Theft of climate funds 
                at such a scale is atrocious, and 
                offenders are akin to climate criminals.”

                Greenpeace says that corruption and 
                greed are undermining the ability of 
                millions of Filipinos to cope with 
                climate change. Every year, millions 
                of Filipinos lose lives, homes and 
                livelihoods due to more frequent and more 
                intense flooding. Floods have also caused 
                massive economic losses for local 
                governments as well as the national 
                government. The flood control projects are 
                meant to protect communities, but the 
                ongoing investigations show that astronomical 
                amounts for these climate adaptation 
                efforts are going to the pockets of 
                greedy government officials and private
                contractors. 

                Meanwhile, the Philippine government doesn’t 
                have enough money to fund its climate 
                adaptation needs or to cover the costs of 
                climate losses and damages. The Department 
                of Finance says that costs in losses and 
                damages in the Philippines from 2010 to 2020 
                amounted to PHP 506.1 billion.2 The government 
                also says that from 2015 to 2022, it spent 
                almost PHP 2 trillion for disaster risk 
                reduction and management.

        <div class="Column">
            <pre class="Paragraphs">
                Money to fund adaptation, however, still falls 
                short of what’s needed. A 2022 World Bank report 
                projected that the Philippines can lose as much 
                as 7.6% of GDP by 2030 and 13.6% by 2040 due to 
                climate change.

                “The corruption scandal puts Filipinos in a 
                hopeless situation: not only is our climate 
                financing woefully inadequate to avoid future 
                losses, but also, more than half of what little 
                allocation we have for climate action is 
                potentially being stolen. Filipinos are left 
                with pitiful change from the billions stolen by 
                a few,” said Chua.

                Chua elaborated that the government is applying 
                for loans and grants to address losses and damages 
                from climate disasters. “Given this filthy track 
                record, what assurance does the Filipino people 
                have that the money for climate adaptation won’t 
                end up in the pockets of the greedy?” he said. 
                “Each new loan pushes us deeper into debt, while 
                corruption drains the borrowed money that’s meant 
                to protect us.”

                Corruption is a significant roadblock to climate 
                action. The country can never achieve its climate 
                targets if corruption is left to operate unchecked. 
                Additionally, Greenpeace noted that the gargantuan 
                budget for climate tagged-projects under the purview 
                of the DPWH shows the government’s shortsighted 
                overreliance on gray infrastructure for climate
                adaptation. The group says that the government must 
                instead put its focus on implementing nature-based 
                and community-led solutions, preserving watersheds,
                stopping mining and quarrying projects that destroy 
                forests and rivers, putting an end to reclamation, 
                and instituting a national ban on single use plastics 
                such as sachets to ease flood problems in major urban 
                areas.

                “Massive corruption on flood control projects at a time 
                of climate change, worsened by the continued extraction
                and operation of fossil fuel companies in the name of 
                profit, is piling one injustice over another onto 
                Filipino communities. Filipinos cannot continue to 
                suffer the double burden of corruption and corporate 
                impunity,” Chua added. “The government must not be deaf 
                to the outrage of Filipinos and must heed the call to 
                exact accountability both from corrupt officials and 
                contractors, as well as from giant fossil fuel companies 
                who are amassing grotesque illegal wealth from people 
                suffering climate impacts. Moreover, given the huge amount 
                of losses the country is facing, the president will need 
                to source funding that does not place any more burden on 
                Filipinos such as in the form of reparations from 
                climate polluters.”


                <i>
                “The greed we’re seeing in this corruption scandal mirrors 
                the greed of fossil fuel corporations that have put us in 
                this climate crisis in the first place and continue their 
                harmful activities, putting the quest for profit over the 
                safety and survival of people and the planet. Alongside 
                this much needed corruption investigation, President 
                Ferdinand Marcos Jr must also hold the world’s biggest 
                climate polluting corporations accountable: make them stop 
                further fossil fuel extraction and production, and make 
                them pay for losses and damages.”

                Filpino’s begin their rally Peace, Stability and Transparency at Luneta park on November 16, 2025 to November 18, 2025.  
                The entire rally was planned by Iglesia Ni Cristo, a very large church in the Philippines. Over 200,000 protesters 
                showed up on Monday, November 17 , 2025 for the second day of the rally and many have set up tents planning to stay 
                overnight till the end of the rally on November 18. </b>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
     <pre class="Paragraphs">
        The reason behind this rally is due to the prominent appearance of corruption in the Philippine government. Many of the 
        protestors wore the standard white INC shirt with the words “Transparency for a Better Democracy”. This is all the cause 
        of the many ghost projects that were supposed to help the country, but was instead spent on the governments luxury 
        lifestyle, leaving millions of Filipinos to suffer while the higher class have no worries in the world. 
        
        Due to this, classes were suspended face-to-face classes on November 17-18 due to the high amounts of people involved in the rally. 

        The president, Bong Bong Marcos’s response to this was a promise to prosecute every single corrupt politician, and have 
        them all jailed by Christmas. 

        There was a estimate of over 15,000 police officers sent out to minimize damage. Though, the original plan of  
        rallying from November 16 to 18, the rally ended shortly after the first day on November 17, as they felt they fulfilled their 
        goal to send a strong enough message to the government and have no need to protest further.

        This rally shows the outrage of every Filipino, with many losing lives and homes due to this up roaring problem. Many people 
        were willing to get injured just to show their anger, which says a lot. Though the government did respond to this, all they 
        gave were promises, but the public wanted action. It’s only a matter of time to see if they really fufill their promise to put 
        all the corrupt politicians in jail.

        San Roque Catholic School conducted the 2nd film 
        festival on November 21 2025 for specific students only.
        Senior high students made short films for selected 
        grade students. The films included horror, drama, 
        love story, comedy, and a one-act play where the 
        students acted live in person. The students watched 
        using a big screen, which gave them a better and

        The film festival was held at San Roque School in Mendiola, 
        Alabang, Muntinlupa City. In the auditorium, students were 
        allowed to bring food but were told to keep the area clean. 
        
        The films and the senior high students who made them were 
        introduced first. The first film, “Giustizia Vendeta,” was 
        about two friends who wanted to become police and their 
        fight against drug lords. 
        
        The second film, “Not in the Script,” was a horror story 
        about four students who went missing, and a phone call 
        later showed what shappened to them. 
        
        The third film, “Summa,” was about a girl who was betrayed, 
        killed herself, and came back as a ghost. 
        
        The fourth film, “Humaling,” was about a girl who loved two 
        boys but later killed them. 
        
        The last presentation was a one-act play called “Gunita,” 
        about friends celebrating the birthday of their friend who 
        had already died.

    San Roque Catholic School once again 
    celebrated its annual March of Saints, 
    gathering students, parents, and 
    teachers for a meaningful showcase 
    of faith and community. The event 
    highlighted the lives of different 
    saints and encouraged students to 
    reflect on values such as kindness, 
    courage, and service.</b>
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>

    <pre class="Paragraphs">
        The celebration began with a short assembly where students arrived in their carefully prepared saint costumes. Each grade level 
        represented a variety of saints, from well-known people like St. Francis of Assisi and St. Teresa of Calcutta, to lesser-known 
        yet inspiring saints. The students walked in a procession around the school and parish, accompanied by teachers and 
        parents(if so).

        The March of Saints is held every year to offer a positive and faith-centered alternative to typical Halloween activities. Instead 
        of scary costumes and themes, the event focuses on the examples set by saints, reminding students that holiness is shown through 
        simple acts of goodness and compassion.

        During the program, selected students were given the chance to shortly introduce the saint they portrayed. This allowed them to 
        share what they learned and why their chosen saint inspires them. Many students expressed that preparing for the event helped them 
        understand the saints not just as historical figures but as real people who made brave choices in their lives.

        The event ended with a short prayer and words of encouragement from the school’s administrators, who thanked the community for their 
        voluunteering and cooperation. The March of Saints continues to be one of SRCS’s most waited activities, strengthening both faith 
        and love within the school.

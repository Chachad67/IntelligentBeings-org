        The Sheikh Zayed Book Award marks the 20th Anniversary next year, among one of the Arab world’s most prestigious prizes. 
        This year’s honors that are awarded in April, were granted on such honored names as Hoda Barakat, a very popular Lebanese author, 
        internationally renowned Haruki Murakami, a Japanese writer, and Andrew Peacock, a British historian.

        Haruki Murakami said “Receiving the Sheikh Zayed Book Award from the United Arab Emirates comes as both a great surprise and an 
        immense honor to me.”. He was awarded the Cultural Personality of the Year accolade for 2025.

        “Arabic is a language with a long and rich storytelling tradition,” Murakami said, “and it is a great honor for me that my books 
        have been translated and are being read in Arab countries. I believe that stories are a universal language. It is my sincere hope 
        that by sharing good stories, people can connect with each other and that this can become a force, even if only a small one, that 
        moves the world toward peace.”

        Since the Sheikh Zayed program’s founding in 2006, there have been 136 awards conferred. New award categories have been added to 
        highlight the breadth of stories, research, cultural contributions and ideas shared in the Arabic world. A translation grant was 
        created in 2018 to support the publication of Arabic literature in new languages and markets around the world, and hundreds of 
        international events have been staged to recognize Arabic culture.

        In its 20 years, the Sheikh Zayed program has gained resonance in many parts of the world. This year, awards received more than 
        4,000 submissions from 75 countries, with winners from Italy, Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, the United 
        Kingdom and Japan.

        The Sheikh Zayed Book Award at the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Center is an independent cultural and Tourism of Abu Dhabi with a 
        stated goal of expanding Arabic literature and culture throughout the whole world.

        In an interview of Publishers Weekly earlier this year, Barakat said “The organizers of this prize, at all levels, are doing a very 
        serious job of supporting the Arabic language in total independence and freedom, and even with a view to an international dimension, 
        since they are helping publishing houses to translate Arabic writers into all the languages of directives or ideology.”

        By celebrating the work of these awarded writers, by supporting publishers around the world who hope to translate this work and bring 
        them to new audiences, and through key events that illustrate the beauty of this culture, this history, this literature and science, 
        the award’s organizers hope to build a bridge between the Arab world and many other cultures.

            The race ran for 57 laps even though he started in third 
            place on the grid, Max made a strong move right away. 
            On turn 1, he passed two rivals (2 mclarens) and pushed 
            forward hard.

            A crash early in the race caused a safety car. Max used this
            chance smartly by pitting for fresh tires while many drivers
            stayed out. This helped him gain an advantage.When the
            race went back to full speed, Max was already in front. His
            rivals tried to catch him, but he stayed fast, managed his tires
            well, and avoided mistakes.

            At the finish line, Max crossed first winning the race by
            nearly 8 seconds. Behind him was Oscar Piastri in second,
            and Carlos Sainz in third.

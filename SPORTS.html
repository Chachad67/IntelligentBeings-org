        Christian McCaffrey leads 49ers to victory against former team Panthers and says “it’s really just business”
    </h1>

    <pre class="Paragraphs">
        Christian McCaffrey helped the San Francisco 49ers to a 20-9 victory over his former team, the 
        Carolina Panthers on Monday Night Football, he enjoyed a big night afterwards. 

        The running back joined the Niners back in 2022, but this was his first time facing the team that 
        drafted him back in 2017.

        The 29 year old Christian McCaffrey seemed relaxed about the big night and set about leading 
        his current team to a much-needed win. McCaffrey stood out as he gained 142 total yards and 
        scored a touchdown.

        After the game, McCaffrey told reporters “When it comes to playing in this league, you have to 
        approach each week as similar as possible, stay in your routine,”

        With his receiving performance, McCaffrey became just the third running back in league history 
        to have over 50 yards in the air in at least 50 career games, along with Larry Centers and 
        Marshal Faulk. 

        While the 49ers may have won the game, the contest wasn’t pretty at times. San Francisco 
        made multiple fouls in the first half, exemplified in part by an underwhelming performance from 
        quarterback Brock Purdy.

        Purdy was intercepted three times in the first half, which Carolina’s offense squandered, scoring 
        only three points off the turnovers, but the signal-caller refused to blame a recent toe injury 
        for his poor display. 

        Meanwhile, the Panther’s, failed to capitalize on their opponents’ early struggles with 
        quarterback Bryce Young who threw 18-of-29 for 169 yards, one touchdown and two 
        interceptions.

        After the Panthers safety Tre’Von Moehrig was seen hitting San Francisco receiver Jauan 
        Jennings in the groin during the closing moments, Jennings responded by striking Moehrig in 
        the head, leading frustrations to bubble over.

        Moehrig, though, acknowledged he might be fined for his actions. 

        The 49ers now have an 86% chance of making the playoffs, while the defeat means the 
        Panthers now have just a 14% chance of reaching the postseason, despite sitting just half a 
        game back of first in the NFC South.
